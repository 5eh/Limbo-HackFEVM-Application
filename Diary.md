# Diary

## Day 1

Today is the first day of the Hackathon of Filecoin.

We are a team of 5. 
Watson, who is the initator of it. 
Pedro just started out his Tech Carrer.
Noah is Backend Developer and sets Up with Watson the PigeonDAO, which is basicall Uber but the web3 version of it.
Steve joined in quite sponteneusly after he wrote "Looking for Group".
There is me, Frank a Web3AR Developerm mostly developing in the Polkadot Eccosystem.

After the initial ceremony, we jump in our Group Discord Video Chat.
Everyone started to telling their Stories and throw some nice Memes and jokes into the converstion. üå§Ô∏è

Watson set up a Figma and I give a quick Introduction of where are the buttons.
Just to get everyone the same Page.

After we had our first rectancle, we started deciding our colorshema and ohter things.

Decision we made.

  + Desktop first approach
  + Dark Design
  + Glassmorphism style
  + [Colorshema](https://coolors.co/343434-454ade-da4167-e7e7e7-e3b505)
  + Markdown centric

Some of us are not the most familiar with markdown, git and the terminal.
So we start spliting.  Noah wraped his head into the FEVM, Watson started to articualte the Idea and polish it, that people get what is goal. Pedro, Steve and me made a crashcourse of the Hackathon neccesities. While splitting we jump between our groups.

Sadly I can give you a precise description of What we are actually building, but to this point it looks to me, that we are focusing on the challenge DataDAO powered by Markdown. Kind of Medium on chain.

## For everyone who is not in the Web3 Bubble a short explanation.
DAO, means Decentralised Atomous Organisation. Correct, web3 is not famous for easy to communicate Words. 

###  Basically a DAO is a Club. 

**Every Club has Members and everye Member is part of the Club. Every Club has a specific Purpose.**
F.e. A Football club is a club of football enthusiats. A Computer Club is a club of computer enthusiats. A Writers Club is a club of Writers. 

**Every Club sets his own rules and values in some kind of Shape.**
F.e. You can get kicked out if a Football Club Member starts a physical fight on a football Match. 

**Every Club has some benefits.**
F.e. In a Writers Club, you get access to people who sharing the same struggle and searching for solution of similar problems. 
Like, 
"I love writing but it seems so to get a paying gig", says new Writers Club Member. 
"I can reccomend, to go in companies office and ask if you can write for them", respondse another Member. 
"Just walk in?" 
"Yes", "No email" 
"Yes, no email, just be nice and ask. What should happen, you get a no and thats it, but thats way better than being ghosted. Worked for me great."
It's often the little things, which are helping the most.

**Every Club can work as his own entity**
F.e. In Germany, we have many Tree Clubs. No joke, btw. Every first of May, people are starting wandering from village to village and eating Currywurst and drinking bear.
Every Village has a huge Tree in center, which works as a anker point.
Every Village has TreeClub and get money from selling Currywurst and Beer.
This money goes into the Clubs treasury. Every two years all ClubMembers are going out to amusement park and the treasury pays for it. If the Club makes to much money, they even have to start paying tax. Then the club pays the tax and not each indivual member.
Thats what I mean, with each Club can work as his own entity.

### What is a DAO

A DAO solves the same problems as Club. It can set his own ruls, every member get benefits, it can work as his own entity. 

The unique feature about a DAO is that its Decentralised and antomous, as the name sugessts. But lets elobrate that later.

A DAO is a piece of Code, which gets ruled by the members.
F.e. 
Every member can press a Button, which says addMember
Every member can press a Button, which says writeProposal
Every member can press a Button, which says vote
Every member can press a Button, which says showMembersList
Every member can press a Button, which says showTreasuryMoney
And many more. Its just a set of things, to make nice buttons.

This Code lives on the Blockchain. 
Blockchain is fancy way to describe a huge excel sheet.
And its really hard to get rid of this excel sheet. 

Lets say you have a DAO, and this DAO can sendMoneys and it does it every Month.
Some Member leaving the DAO and some lost their access to the dao, so there is noone else to invite other Members.
Yeah thats screwed, because than noone can stop the Code.
And he send happily ever after, the money.
You can try to call of your friends to stop running the programm.
But its decentralised, so many computers/people on many places.
Even if get one down, you have to convince 5000++ to shut it down.
In the meantime noone else should join, because just 1 computer is necessary to keep it running. In comparison with centralised instution, this is a nightmare.
A centralised instution like Volkswagen, who ships to their Volkswagen Seller ever Month X Amount of cars, can be crushed by the Goverment/Law to deliver it. If this code would be executed on the Blockchain, then heads have to fall in the Volkswagen group.
With this paragraph I already explained automanous, if you didn't realised it.

Lets break it down.

A DAO is a Decentralise antomous Organisation. 

Its a Club, which is ruled by his Members.
Every Member, will get some Benefits in some form or shape.
Every Club can work as his own entity.
Every Club set is own Rules.
Every Rule is set in Stone.
Its really hard to get rid of it.

### What is a Data DAO

Yes, that is a good Question. I am a Developer in this Space and never heard of a the word Data DAO. That means its new. But the name is already quite self explantory.
Data can be everything. How many miles you were walking today. The tweet that you send out. The Markdown file that I am writing, right now. 
As we already know, a DAO is a club.
So a Data DAO has to be a Club for Dataowners.
You are joining a Data DAO of running People.
Your Smartwatch records every step.
This Data has no much worth as a single entity.
Lets say you have 10k Runners in the Club.
Everyone share is Running Data to the Club.
Now this Data gets more and more valuable, more people are joining.
A Animation Company can buy this Data to train their Algorithm for their Animation Characters, which leads to a tool which allows Animators to their Job 100x faster.
This tool you can definitly sell and earn some profit.
This kind of data akkumulation led to the rise of our well known Data Giants.
Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. 
A Data Dao would give their Members their Data back, in their Hands.
If every Member doesnt like to sell their running Data to Disney, then there is no trade. Because Every DAO is controlled by his members and the rules are set in Stone. 

Back to the topic.
