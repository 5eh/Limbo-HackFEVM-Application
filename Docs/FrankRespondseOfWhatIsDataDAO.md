good question^^

In my head its a smart contract which holds a bunch of Data and a bunch of member something like this

UglyPseudoCode
SolidityThingie
```js
Members = [WatsonMetaMaskAddress, NoahMetaMaskAddress, FrankMetaMaskAddress]

function putContent(address, content){
Member[address].push(content) 
}
``` 
Frontendthingie
```js
watsonMetaMaskAddresss = 0xjlksfadkjl√∂jlkasd
WatsonContent = [{
name: MyStoryOfUganda,
ipfshash: weroisfjlkwDASwlsiddlgos,
},
{
name: MyStoryOfUgandaPart2,
ipfshash: wjlkhxcsdasaASwlsiddlgos,
},
{
name: MyStoryOfUgandaPart3,
ipfshash: hrerrggskwDASwlsiddlgos,
}]
web3.methods.putContent(watsonMetaMaskAddress, WatonsContent).transfer("1","ether")
```

and every member has a Balance of some sort :man_shrugging:


Basically make a list of members
Each Member has a list of Content 

I think that counts as a Data daoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Tricky could be to make some fancy function
nonFacnyButValidFunction would be
function tip(address){}
fancy wouldbe maybe function stakeWithAuthor(address)

What about retaining the information for journalists on the platform? Just so we're not a point of exposure for those participants telling their story?
you got me confused with the last part of that first message üòÜ But yeah we'll figure it out later, I'm just vibing anyways

for the Data DAO - we can have volunteer researchers push their research and news backing/supporting stories on chain, where then we can have a sidechain or a tip jar for anyone who voluntarily contributes, maybe this would be helpful... who knows

### Frank

From a SmartContract DAO site, we dont care about the Plattform. We are just a Backend which can be used by Newssites or BlogSites or DocumentationSites or ...
Everyone who wants to use content has to interact with the SmartContract and call of diffrent kind of function from the DAO, like beAuthorsFriend(address author) or putMyFilecoinETHWherTheAuthorsETHIs(address author)

From a Plattform/Blog/News/...DAPP site, we care about the participants and how they interact with it and what benefits they have, if they use the Application

I think one question was related to the DAO and the other question was related to the Dapp alias "Blog" right? ü§î


### Watson

I'm just specifically worried about if people who tell their stories are vulnerable to their opposition if they can view the smart contracts and the persons personal information 
SEO optimization can be a good way to monetize the application, so data should be collected, afterall this is trying to be a sustainable project, however, putting people at risk to tell their story sounds like the opposite of what the right/just intentions should be
