<h2 id="a-diary-of-day-1">A Diary of Day 1</h2>
<p>Today is the first day of the Hackathon of Filecoin.</p>
<p>We are a team of 5. Watson, who is the initator of it. Pedro just
started out his Tech Career. Noah is a Backend Developer and Watson is a
Frontend Developer, and they run PigeonDAO, which is basically Uber for
packages but the web3 version. Steve joined in quite sponteneusly after
he wrote ‚ÄúLooking for Group‚Äù. Then there is me, Frank a Web3AR Developer
mostly developing in the Polkadot Eccosystem.</p>
<p>After the initial ceremony, we jumped into a Group Discord Video
Chat. Everyone started telling their Stories and throwing some nice
Memes and jokes into the converstion. üå§Ô∏è</p>
<p>Watson set up a Figma and I give a quick Introduction of where the
buttons are. Just to get everyone the same Page.</p>
<p>After we had our first rectangle, we started deciding our colorshema
and other things.</p>
<p>Decisions we made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop first approach</li>
<li>Dark Design</li>
<li>Glassmorphism style</li>
<li><a
href="https://coolors.co/343434-454ade-da4167-e7e7e7-e3b505">Colorshema</a></li>
<li>Markdown centric</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of us are not the most familiar with markdown, git and the
terminal.</p>
<p>So we start spliting.</p>
<p>Noah wraped his head into the FEVM, Watson started to articualte the
Idea and polish it, that people get what is goal. Pedro, Steve and me
made a crashcourse of the Hackathon neccesities. While we were splitting
we jump between our groups.</p>
<p>Sadly I can give you a precise description of What we are actually
building, but to this point it looks to me, that we are focusing on the
challenge DataDAO powered by Markdown.</p>
<p><strong>Kind of Medium on chain.</strong></p>
<h2
id="for-everyone-who-is-not-in-the-web3-bubble-a-short-explanation.">For
everyone who is not in the Web3 Bubble a short explanation.</h2>
<p>DAO, means Decentralised Atomous Organisation. Correct, web3 is not
famous for easy to communicate Words.</p>
<h3 id="basically-a-dao-is-a-club.">Basically a DAO is a Club.</h3>
<p><strong>Every Club has Members and everye Member is part of the Club.
Every Club has a specific Purpose.</strong></p>
<p>F.e. A Football club is a club of football enthusiats. A Computer
Club is a club of computer enthusiats. A Writers Club is a club of
Writers.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club sets his own rules and values in some kind of
Shape.</strong></p>
<p>F.e. You can get kicked out if a Football Club Member starts a
physical fight on a football Match.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club has some benefits.</strong></p>
<p>F.e. In a Writers Club, you get access to people who sharing the same
struggle and searching for solution of similar problems. Like,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love writing but it seems so to get a paying gig‚Äù, says new
Writers Club Member.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can reccomend, to go in companies office and ask if you can write
for them‚Äù, respondse another Member.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJust walk in?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo email?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, no email, just be nice and ask. What should happen, you get a
no and thats it, but thats way better than being ghosted. Worked for me
great.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs often the little things, which are helping the most.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club can work as his own entity</strong></p>
<p>F.e. In Germany, we have many Tree Clubs.</p>
<p>No joke, btw. Every first of May, people are starting wandering from
village to village and eating Currywurst and drinking bear. Every
Village has a huge Tree in center, which works as a anker point. Every
Village has TreeClub and get money from selling Currywurst and Beer.</p>
<p>This money goes into the Clubs treasury. Every two years all
ClubMembers are going out to amusement park and the treasury pays for
it. If the Club makes to much money, they even have to start paying tax.
Then the club pays the tax and not each indivual member.</p>
<p>Thats what I mean, with each Club can work as his own entity.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-dao">What is a DAO</h3>
<p>A DAO solves the same problems as Club. It can set his own ruls,
every member get benefits, it can work as his own entity.</p>
<p>The unique feature about a DAO is that its Decentralised and
autonomous, as the name sugessts. But lets elobrate that later.</p>
<p><strong>A DAO is a piece of Code, which gets ruled by the
members.</strong></p>
<p>F.e. Every member can press a Button, which says addMember Every
member can press a Button, which says writeProposal Every member can
press a Button, which says vote Every member can press a Button, which
says showMembersList Every member can press a Button, which says
showTreasuryMoney And many more. Its just a set of things, to make nice
buttons.</p>
<p><strong>This Code lives on the Blockchain.</strong></p>
<p>Blockchain is fancy way to describe a huge excel sheet. And its
really hard to get rid of this excel sheet.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a DAO, and this DAO can send money and it does it
every Month.</p>
<p>Some Member leaving the DAO and some lost their access to the dao, so
there is noone else to invite other Members.</p>
<p>Yeah thats screwed, because than noone can stop the Code.</p>
<p>And he send happily ever after, the money. üêí</p>
<p>You can try to call of your friends to stop running the programm.</p>
<p>But its decentralised, so many computers/people on many places.</p>
<p>Even if get one down, you have to convince 5000++ to shut it
down.</p>
<p>In the meantime noone else should join, because just 1 computer is
necessary to keep it running. In comparison with centralised instution,
this is a nightmare.</p>
<p>A centralised instution like Volkswagen, who ships to their
Volkswagen Seller ever Month X Amount of cars, can be crushed by the
Goverment/Law to deliver it.</p>
<p>If this code would be executed on the Blockchain, then heads have to
fall in the Volkswagen group.</p>
<p>With this paragraph I already explained automanous, if you didn‚Äôt
realised it.</p>
<p><strong>Lets break it down.</strong></p>
<h3 id="a-dao-is-a-decentralise-antomous-organisation.">A DAO is a
Decentralise antomous Organisation.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Its a Club, which is ruled by his Members.</li>
<li>Every Member, will get some Benefits in some form or shape.</li>
<li>Every Club can work as his own entity.</li>
<li>Every Club set is own Rules.</li>
<li>Every Rule is set in Stone.</li>
<li>Its really hard to get rid of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-is-a-data-dao">So, what is a Data DAO?</h3>
<p>Yes, that is a good Question. I am a Developer in this Space and
never heard of a the word Data DAO. That means its new. But the name is
already quite self explantory.</p>
<p>Data can be anything.</p>
<p><strong>F.e.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many miles you were walking today.</li>
<li>The tweet that you send out.</li>
<li>The Markdown file that I am writing, right now.</li>
<li>‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<p>As we already know, a DAO is a club. So a Data DAO has to be a Club
for Dataowners.</p>
<p>F.e. You are joining a Data DAO of running People. Your Smartwatch
records every step. This Data has no much worth as a single entity. Lets
say you have 10k Runners in the Club. Everyone share is Running Data to
the Club.</p>
<p>Now this Data gets more and more valuable, more people are joining. A
Animation Company can buy this Data to train their Algorithm for their
Animation Characters, which leads to a tool which allows Animators to
their Job 100x faster. This tool you can definitly sell and earn some
profit. This kind of data accumulation leds to the rise of our well
known Data Giants. <em>(Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. )</em></p>
<p><strong>A Data Dao would give their Members their Data back, in their
Hands.</strong></p>
<p>If every Member doesnt like to sell their running Data to Disney,
then there is no trade. Because Every DAO is controlled by his members
and the rules are set in Stone.</p>
<p>And now back to our Hackthon Diary.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-our-story">Back to the our Story</h2>
<p>We just splitted in diffrent groups. We had Group Ideation lead by
Watson and joined by Noah. They tried to articulate the Idea in the best
possible manner. As a framework to work in they choose the Pitch. Set up
a Google Slides and ‚Äúbraindumbed‚Äù everything what was in their head.
Then they refinded everything to get to a point where everything get
more refinded.</p>
<p>In the meantime I, Frank, made quick Crashcourse of git, the terminal
and other Stuff. If you are interested what I consider as the basics,
you can look thruh my Notes. Or to keep it short here is a rough
table</p>

<h2 id="sum-it-up">Sum it up</h2>
<p>That was a really nice first day. We were exicted for the following
two days.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="pedro-addition">Pedro Addition üëæ</h2>
<p><strong>Product vision:</strong></p>
<p>Limbo Dao is orientated to give a voice to that people who doesn‚Äôt
have the means to portrait their message to the world, we also want to
give proffesionals comunicators a way to legitimaze their work and
geting pay for ir, all with a social cause in mind, help the people in
need from all around the world.</p>
<p>This way we create a <code>win-win</code> situation, where minorities
can have a voice, so people all around the world can hear them, and
understand the social situation this remote cominuties are living, we
see this as a very important contribution to the people and socieaty in
general, while using a technology we love so much, we aim to improve our
abilities and knowledge so we can keep creating descentralized
journalism and create a safe space for all communities to engage, social
conscience, and promote free speech.</p>
<p>We also take pride on the use of web3 for our applications, since
this technologies allow to contrubutors(journalists, photograpers) to
upload their work in a form of anonimity and still be paid, we are also
giving the oportunity to low income community to be funded, and allow
the social development of its people.</p>
