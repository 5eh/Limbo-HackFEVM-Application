<p>A man came to sleep in the street because of his brother. It’s one of
the dramas next to us. A gentleman slept in the street. So what? They
will replicate many. Have you ever thought you might be in a similar
situation?</p>
<p>If you, God, shame, assuming absurdly, would you get to sleep in the
street, would it make sense for someone to stop and ask what can be of
use to you? I think so. That’s how I came to talk to a fresh bosquer,
but also to those who know the story.</p>
<p>He was warming up to the heat of dreams</p>
<p>We were passing by the fence and saw him sleep. I was wondering what
to do with him. Dressed in jeans and training. A jacket served him as a
blanket. A newspaper and the naked box of a yogurt warmed her naked
back. When he turned, his bones were cracked. He did not hear, did not
see. She was just asleep.</p>
<p>I spoke with several people in a similar situation who told me they
were no longer good because of exhaustion. “A chronic fatigue that never
stops you. That’s why you tend to have drugs: cigarettes, alcohol, or
anything else. That’s how many people get to drugs.” My man stood in the
shade of a fence, dressed in winter clothes. Yeah, yeah, he was warming
up to the heat of dreams. She just opened an eye as he heard me. “No,
I’m not sorry. I had no place to sleep at night. They drove me away.
They kicked me out. Give me peace,”he replied. To find out something
about him, I turned around a little. I got to the closest carpet and I
found out almost all the friends of his acquaintances.</p>
<p>The man is about 38-39 years old. He worked as a driver, a good
professional. She does not work anymore. On the day he managed to eat
well. “It is only after he can get some food to rest,” says a neighbor.
He lived until recently upstairs right in the building where our store
was located, says the vendor. His brother sold the upstairs home. He
gave him a bunch, and now he sleeps where he can. Usually the day, under
the tree, near the fence. It’s woe to his head, he was not drunk, but
now he started drinking a little bit of trouble. Do you know him well? I
ask. Yeah, very good, says the woman. His brother sold the house. He’s a
man. She only gave her some money. So he got to sleep in the street.
Passers pass, look, but do not ask him anything: whether he is sick or
needs something. Or maybe he died.</p>
<p>Is that so! The man began to sleep this summer near the cursed fence.
Now the autumn arrives, their sales are empty. He’ll get rheumatism. A
drama, like many others. I wondered what I could offer him, a blanket, a
tip to go to an empowered institution to give him protection? How does
all this help a man on earth? Tonight was announced a low-temperature
night. The menis warming up with dreams and maybe with the hope that
someone with good soul in the area will take it and take it somewhere
where it will be better and it will recover.</p>
