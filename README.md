## Limbo-HackFEVM

### Inspiration

Creating hope for the individuals in dire circumstances

103 MILLION around the world are forcibly displaced
We can read, but they cannot.

Left without a voice, they are in a state of loss and desperate to find a place where they are welcomed and can share their story. But they are currently unable to, because...they are in Limbo.

Would it ever be possible to understand how they feel, we imagined. What can we do to help them,
and give them a voice with which to speak.

How about we dedicate this hackathon to building a protocol that can both protect and amplify their voice, we decided.

This is why we decided to work on Limbo, a first web3 decentralised media journalism protocol.

We hope that this project would allow our friends to share their thoughts and experiences in a way that they are proteced and which they can monetize. 

### What it does?

At the moment it does not a lot.
We seperated Backend from Frontend.
In the Frontend we sketched things out, that we preSketch in [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/QrZVocHLWPcRigUymCbNOB/Limbo?node-id=15%3A2&t=DZ2V5mLH5kjON0L4-0)\
The Backend Lives on Remix and the Markdown Files are hosted on IPFS.

We have succesfully deployed an ERC1155 Token on **FEVM** and we found a nice Marketplace Contract, which works at the moment as a Storage Interaction. 

Front and Backend is not Connected, but thats ok :D

### What we learned

Everyone of us has their own goal. 

[x] - Frank = Play with Foundry & Glassmorphism design. 
[x] - Steve = Learn more about Web3 and the inner workings
[x] - Pedro = Get more familar with a regular Dev Workflow
[x] - Watson = Draft Limbo in a quick manner. Is in his pipeline for Months.
[x] - Noah = Play around with FEVM and their deployment Structure.

Everyone could reach their goal in some Sense.
