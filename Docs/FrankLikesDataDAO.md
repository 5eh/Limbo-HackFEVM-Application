That looks nice😁 

I would love to take the topic DataDao, because it sounds really fancy🐵
Basically a DataDao around markdown and the Dapp will be a Blog of some sort. 
What kind of sort, i dont know, could be everything (fireworker, technical doc writer, fashion, 3rd World, War in Ukraine, Politics, ehhh yeah.. and so on^^)
@Watson.pgn right?, or did i messed the orginal intention somehow up🙈
