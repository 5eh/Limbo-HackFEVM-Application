## A Diary of Day 2

This time we keep it shorter. 🌤️

+ We turned the figma sketch in a design system. Typo, Icongraphy, Picture, ... there is a link
+ Frank and Pedro wrote a diary.md for a mockup, which got converted to html to put it on ipfs, 
and maybe wrap it into a glassmorhism design
+ We introduced more github features like branching and checkout it, and merging
+ We looked into remix and deployed a function
+ We looked into goerli
+ Frank worked on foundry, messed up many time, but made some good progress
+ We decided we wanted to deploy a simple nft (image, description, ..)
+ Steve, Noah and Watson worked on the Pitch Deck and the articulation of the project idea
+ Frank and Pedro set up wsl for exploration, and started glassmorphism as a card, 
but realised it was too time intensive
+ We went struggled with the FEVM Application
+ We spoke to different people, such as @dropout_founder in the HackFEVM community chat
+ Noah and Watson mangaged to get started on the application frontend
