<h1 class="title">Day</h1>

<h1 id="diary">Diary</h1>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>Today is the first day of the Hackathon of Filecoin.</p>
<p>We are a team of 5. Watson, who is the initator of it. Pedro just
started out his Tech Carrer. Noah is Backend Developer and sets Up with
Watson the PigeonDAO, which is basicall Uber but the web3 version of it.
Steve joined in quite sponteneusly after he wrote ‚ÄúLooking for Group‚Äù.
There is me, Frank a Web3AR Developerm mostly developing in the Polkadot
Eccosystem.</p>
<p>After the initial ceremony, we jump in our Group Discord Video Chat.
Everyone started to telling their Stories and throw some nice Memes and
jokes into the converstion. üå§Ô∏è</p>
<p>Watson set up a Figma and I give a quick Introduction of where are
the buttons. Just to get everyone the same Page.</p>
<p>After we had our first rectancle, we started deciding our colorshema
and ohter things.</p>
<p>Decision we made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop first approach</li>
<li>Dark Design</li>
<li>Glassmorphism style</li>
<li><a
href="https://coolors.co/343434-454ade-da4167-e7e7e7-e3b505">Colorshema</a></li>
<li>Markdown centric</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of us are not the most familiar with markdown, git and the
terminal. So we start spliting. Noah wraped his head into the FEVM,
Watson started to articualte the Idea and polish it, that people get
what is goal. Pedro, Steve and me made a crashcourse of the Hackathon
neccesities. While splitting we jump between our groups.</p>
<p>Sadly I can give you a precise description of What we are actually
building, but to this point it looks to me, that we are focusing on the
challenge DataDAO powered by Markdown. Kind of Medium on chain.</p>
<h2
id="for-everyone-who-is-not-in-the-web3-bubble-a-short-explanation.">For
everyone who is not in the Web3 Bubble a short explanation.</h2>
<p>DAO, means Decentralised Atomous Organisation. Correct, web3 is not
famous for easy to communicate Words.</p>
<h3 id="basically-a-dao-is-a-club.">Basically a DAO is a Club.</h3>
<p><strong>Every Club has Members and everye Member is part of the Club.
Every Club has a specific Purpose.</strong> F.e. A Football club is a
club of football enthusiats. A Computer Club is a club of computer
enthusiats. A Writers Club is a club of Writers.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club sets his own rules and values in some kind of
Shape.</strong> F.e. You can get kicked out if a Football Club Member
starts a physical fight on a football Match.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club has some benefits.</strong> F.e. In a Writers
Club, you get access to people who sharing the same struggle and
searching for solution of similar problems. Like, ‚ÄúI love writing but it
seems so to get a paying gig‚Äù, says new Writers Club Member. ‚ÄúI can
reccomend, to go in companies office and ask if you can write for them‚Äù,
respondse another Member. ‚ÄúJust walk in?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo email‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, no
email, just be nice and ask. What should happen, you get a no and thats
it, but thats way better than being ghosted. Worked for me great.‚Äù It‚Äôs
often the little things, which are helping the most.</p>
<p><strong>Every Club can work as his own entity</strong> F.e. In
Germany, we have many Tree Clubs. No joke, btw. Every first of May,
people are starting wandering from village to village and eating
Currywurst and drinking bear. Every Village has a huge Tree in center,
which works as a anker point. Every Village has TreeClub and get money
from selling Currywurst and Beer. This money goes into the Clubs
treasury. Every two years all ClubMembers are going out to amusement
park and the treasury pays for it. If the Club makes to much money, they
even have to start paying tax. Then the club pays the tax and not each
indivual member. Thats what I mean, with each Club can work as his own
entity.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-dao">What is a DAO</h3>
<p>A DAO solves the same problems as Club. It can set his own ruls,
every member get benefits, it can work as his own entity.</p>
<p>The unique feature about a DAO is that its Decentralised and
antomous, as the name sugessts. But lets elobrate that later.</p>
<p>A DAO is a piece of Code, which gets ruled by the members. F.e. Every
member can press a Button, which says addMember Every member can press a
Button, which says writeProposal Every member can press a Button, which
says vote Every member can press a Button, which says showMembersList
Every member can press a Button, which says showTreasuryMoney And many
more. Its just a set of things, to make nice buttons.</p>
<p>This Code lives on the Blockchain. Blockchain is fancy way to
describe a huge excel sheet. And its really hard to get rid of this
excel sheet.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a DAO, and this DAO can sendMoneys and it does it
every Month. Some Member leaving the DAO and some lost their access to
the dao, so there is noone else to invite other Members. Yeah thats
screwed, because than noone can stop the Code. And he send happily ever
after, the money. You can try to call of your friends to stop running
the programm. But its decentralised, so many computers/people on many
places. Even if get one down, you have to convince 5000++ to shut it
down. In the meantime noone else should join, because just 1 computer is
necessary to keep it running. In comparison with centralised instution,
this is a nightmare. A centralised instution like Volkswagen, who ships
to their Volkswagen Seller ever Month X Amount of cars, can be crushed
by the Goverment/Law to deliver it. If this code would be executed on
the Blockchain, then heads have to fall in the Volkswagen group. With
this paragraph I already explained automanous, if you didn‚Äôt realised
it.</p>
<p>Lets break it down.</p>
<p>A DAO is a Decentralise antomous Organisation.</p>
<p>Its a Club, which is ruled by his Members. Every Member, will get
some Benefits in some form or shape. Every Club can work as his own
entity. Every Club set is own Rules. Every Rule is set in Stone. Its
really hard to get rid of it.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-data-dao">What is a Data DAO</h3>
<p>Yes, that is a good Question. I am a Developer in this Space and
never heard of a the word Data DAO. That means its new. But the name is
already quite self explantory. Data can be everything. How many miles
you were walking today. The tweet that you send out. The Markdown file
that I am writing, right now. As we already know, a DAO is a club. So a
Data DAO has to be a Club for Dataowners. You are joining a Data DAO of
running People. Your Smartwatch records every step. This Data has no
much worth as a single entity. Lets say you have 10k Runners in the
Club. Everyone share is Running Data to the Club. Now this Data gets
more and more valuable, more people are joining. A Animation Company can
buy this Data to train their Algorithm for their Animation Characters,
which leads to a tool which allows Animators to their Job 100x faster.
This tool you can definitly sell and earn some profit. This kind of data
akkumulation led to the rise of our well known Data Giants. Google,
Amazon, Facebook, etc. A Data Dao would give their Members their Data
back, in their Hands. If every Member doesnt like to sell their running
Data to Disney, then there is no trade. Because Every DAO is controlled
by his members and the rules are set in Stone.</p>
