1. Build presentation? : 100% Yes, 3 day weekend sprint, early builder program, FVM young founders programs (if we commit to it, then this project can be expanded, FVM can help us build it and we can help them utilize our app) - if you want to build after the Hackathon
2. Social Impact? : Many different factors, technical building is a priority for them, make sure they hold USEFUL data (social impact = USEFUL data)
3. Hack is focused primarily on FVM, or code on Solidity
Yeah so basically: Create cool tech, create cool story, create great impact, create personal story, create cool looking front end, win
Easy
