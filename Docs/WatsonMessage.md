Goal of the Hackathon: have a good time!, second goal - To create a distributed media content platform where journalists can distribute stories of minorities lives & events that has lead them to where they are.

What we're achieving when goal is completed: By using IPFS in this project, we are able to record and journal authentic stories from anywhere in the world, and by introducing and teaching minorities about crypto and blockchains, we can then provide the opportunity to help normalize the use of Web3 - and by creating a transparent/authentic source of journalism, long term benefits include business/enterprises/individuals being accountable for the content they distribute and share online.

Tools used in this Hackathon:
- IPFS: Must create a way to convert the story, image and fees onto a IPFS site
- NFT: Must create a tangible/scalable way for making it easy for journalists to create an NFT listing, must create a way to give a fee to journalist and participant for every sale
- L2 cost optimization: Must find a sustainable tool needed to reduce costs
Roles: 
- Design systems: Someone must create the entire UI across all platforms
- NFT integration: Someone must create a link that journalists connect their wallet to then mint an NFT
- Markdown: Someone must create a markdown converter from the NFT integration
- IPFS: Once the markdown is created, convert the Markdown into an IPFS site
- Education resources: Because we want to teach minorities about crypto, journalists need an efficient way for distributing Web3 knowledge, so we need a template and approach to familiarize journalists on how to educate minorities (if they're interested)
Are we all free to call on Friday at around 1? This is when the Hackathon starts
I think we should stay on call through the weekend
Sunday I work at 4:15 and the winners are announced at 4:00, so I'll work Sunday ðŸ˜„
I personally think the absolute best way of us winning is by sharing live stories and live impactful events going on today and last week, I think Frank was suggesting I find a minority so I think that's a good idea and I'll try and find someone during the time
